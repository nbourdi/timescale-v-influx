# Generate Data and Queries

We recommend generating data and queries for both Timescale and Influx before setting them up.

Open a terminal, navigate to the repo's /scripts directory and execute the relevant scripts.

```bash
$ ./generate_all_queries.sh
$ ./generate_all_data.sh
```

You can now continue to setting up and benchmarking [Influx](https://github.com/nbourdi/timescale-v-influx/blob/main/docs/influx) or [Timescale](https://github.com/nbourdi/timescale-v-influx/blob/main/docs/timescale)
